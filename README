# Alpha Zero Boosted

A "build to learn" implementation of the [Alpha
Zero](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961) algorithm written in Python
and that uses the LightGBM (a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree or GBDT ) ML model
in place of the Deep Neural Network for value/policy functions.

A few "environments" (aka "games") are implemented: Quoridor, Connect
Four, Tic-Tac-Toe.


# Running

## Play a game

```python3.7 play.py <environment> <species-generation> <species-generation> <time-to-move>```
```python3.7 play.py connect_four mcts_gbdt-1 human 5.0```


## Train a bot

```python3.7 train_bot.py <environment> <species> <num batches>```
```python3.7 train_bot.py connect_four mcts_gbdt 10```
